# What is Gilgamesh? #

The program runs quietly in the system tray, keeping GMU students logged in to SNAP so they can access the Internet.

# Is Gilgamesh Safe? #

Some GMU students worry that the IT department prohibits Gilgamesh, or that they will be penalized for using it. Let us clear this up now: Gilgamesh does not in any way hack, bypass, or otherwise the normal login process. It simply logs in automatically at regular intervals, saving students some effort.

One way we ensure ITU compatibility is playing nice. Just because we could have Gilgamesh login once a minute doesn't mean we should. That would clog MasonResNet with unnecessary overhead traffic. We simply aim to match the functionality of the [Odyssey Client](http://itusupport.gmu.edu/downloads/index.asp).

# Why does't Gilgamesh work on Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.? #

This project is new. We're working on it. In the mean time, try out the [scripts](http://code.google.com/p/gilgamesh-applet/source/browse/#svn/trunk/scripts).
